# Instructions

This ```data-project``` [subdirectory](data-project/) contains a typical data project (written in R) done by a researcher. Evaluate the directory/file structure of the project and recognize the common problems that can occur.

How would you organize the project such that a collaborator will be able to be somewhat productive quickly? As it stands, the code may not even work due to a missing library that is not part of the standard R distribution.

There are some good resources on naming things and reproducibility that you can consult if you were to do a search on the Internet.

Your task is as follows:

1. Re-organize the folder/file structure along with any file naming conventions that you think is reasonable.
2. Update the R source code file(s) to reflect your new changes and make it work. Update the ```data-project``` README.md file to be more useful to a collaborator. Things you may to document: Software requirements, package dependencies, how to run the code, what are the file formats of the data, what are the input and output files.
3. Bonus: Package this project in an isolated, portable and reproducible way. Update your documentation where necessary.

# Notes
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete this assignment. My RStudio decided to bug-out and crash on launch even after a re-installation. If possible, I would still like to complete it and gain more experience with RStudio
