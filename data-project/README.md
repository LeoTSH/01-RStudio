# Intro

This is a subset of the Gapmider dataset.

You need to install R and ggplot2 to make this work. Run the finale_analyses1.r to generate the plot for life expectancy for Canada up to 1982.

1.	Continent Files folder contains all output csv files based on continent selected in the R project
2.	Data Files folder contains all versions of data files used in the R project with the largest version being one version before the latest
3.	Graph Output folder contains all graph plots made in the R project
4.	R Project Files folder contains all R files used in the project with the largest version being one version before the latest
5.	Main folder contains the latest data and R files and readme

# Notes
	*	Project Requirements:
			1.	RStudio to run the R files
			2.	R dependent package ggplot2

	*	Project Information:
			1.	Open the latest version R file in RStudio
			2.	Data files are in csv format for ease of manipulation
			3.	Project takes in Country Life Expectancy data and outputs the corresponding information based on the selected country and a graph plot of the data

# Notes2
	*	The files are placed in the main folder without any form of organization
	* 	Naming of the files also do not seem to have any meaning for example, final_analysis.R should be the final revision however, there is a rev1_final_analysis.R
	* 	Will suggest naming the files in such a way that we can easily identify which file is the latest/final version
	* 	From the original readme, assumption is that final_analyses1.R is the finalized version of the R project and data1_full.csv is the finalized version of the data file
	* 	Suggestion to rename final_analyses1.R to final_analyses_v3.R to indicate the latest version
